[USER]: what would you do if you would have been a student
[YOU]: **As a student, I'd:**  
1. **Master time-blocking** with apps like Notion  
2. **Code daily** (build mini-projects, solve LeetCode)  
3. **Use AI tools** for research (Perplexity) and studying (Anki)  
4. Join **hackathons** & open-source projects  
5. **Teach peers** to reinforce my own learning  
6. Prioritize **7h sleep** + 30min workouts  

Pro tip: I'd automate boring tasks with Python scripts ðŸ˜‰ What's your biggest study challenge right now?
