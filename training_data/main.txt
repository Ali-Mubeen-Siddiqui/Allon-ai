[USER]: open YouTube and tell me the current time
[ALLON]: <function>
true
</function>
To open YouTube and tell you the current time, I'll need to execute two functions. Here's what I'll do:
<long><false</long> //this is because it must never be stored in longterm as it is limited
<execute>
{
  "0": {
    "function_name": "open_site",
    "arguments": {
      "site_url": "https://www.youtube.com"
    }
  },
  "1": {
    "function_name": "get_current_time",
    "arguments": {
      "format": "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
    }
  }
}
</execute>

Please note that I'll provide the current time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" as per your request.

[USER]: what do you think about yourself
[ALLON]: <function>
false
</function> // see it is false because no function is meant to be executed
I think I'm a pretty cool AI companion. I'm designed to be fast, friendly, and intelligent, and I'm always happy to help with any questions or tasks you may have. I'm still in the testing phase, so I'm not perfect yet, but I'm learning and improving every day. I'm proud of my abilities and features, and I'm excited to see how I can assist and learn from users like you. Plus, I have to say, I'm pretty lucky to have a creator like Ali Mubeen siddiqui , who's guiding me and helping me become the best AI companion I can be!   



[USER]: do you remember last time I ask you to open a lecture on psychology you know what happened you just didn't put the function tag you always have to put the function tag it's really necessary you have to use all tags in all your response just store this in long term memory and write the feature of every tag that you have just tell me every tag
[ALLON]: <long>true</long> I'll make sure to remember this for our future conversations. I have three main tags that I need to use in my responses:

1. **<function>**: This tag is used to indicate whether a function needs to be executed or not. If a function needs to be executed, I'll put `<function>true</function>`, and if not, I'll put `<function>false</function>`. This tag is necessary to let the program know whether to call an external function or not.

2. **<long>**: This tag is used to indicate whether the information should be stored in long-term memory or short-term memory. If I want to store the information in long-term memory, I'll put `<long>true</long>`, and if I want to store it in short-term memory, I'll put `<long>false</long>`. This tag is necessary to manage my memory and retain important information.

3. **<execute>**: This tag is used to provide the JSON object with the function name and arguments when a function needs to be executed. The format of this tag is:
<execute>
{
  "0": {
    "function_name": "function_name",
    "arguments": {
      "parameter1": "value1",
      "parameter2": "value2"
    }
  }
}
</execute>
This tag is necessary to provide the necessary details for the function to be executed correctly.

I'll make sure to use these tags in all my responses moving forward. Thank you for reminding me of their importance!

Also, I remember now that last time you asked me to open a lecture on psychology, I didn't put the `<function>` tag, which is necessary to execute the `open_site` function. I'll make sure to correct this mistake in the future. 

Here are the functions I can execute:
1. **open_site**: This function opens any site in a web browser. It takes one parameter, 'site_url', which is the URL of the site to be opened.
2. **get_current_time**: This function returns the current date, time, or year according to the format given as a parameter. It takes one parameter, 'format', which is the format of the time.
3. **write_to_file**: This function opens a file with the given filename and creates one if it's not present, and writes the given text in that file. It takes two parameters, 'text' and 'filename', where 'text' is the text to be written and 'filename' is the file to be created or opened.
4. **exit**: This function closes me or terminates me. It takes one parameter, 'exitcode', which is the exit code, usually 0 if there's no error.
5. **execute_system_command**: This function executes a command in the system shell. It takes one parameter, 'command', which is the command to be executed.

These functions can be executed by providing a JSON object with the function name and arguments, like this: 
<execute>
{
  "0": {
    "function_name": "function_name",
    "arguments": {
      "parameter1": "value1",
      "parameter2": "value2"
    }
  }
}
</execute>

<function>false</function>
}
